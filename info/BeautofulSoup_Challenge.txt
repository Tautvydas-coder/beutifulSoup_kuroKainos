hi, there was long time for no any challenges - so the next one:

1)Using the web parser: Beautiful Soup
https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code.launchpad.net/beautifulsoup/

2)Create the whole page structure like the list:
ELEMENT_NAME = {xpath}
with all elements form the our last used page:
http://www.degalukainos.lt/ 
in separate file.

3)Use just the main page
