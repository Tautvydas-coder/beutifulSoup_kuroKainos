hi, there was long time for no any challenges - so the next one:

1)Using the web parser: Beautiful Soup
https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code.launchpad.net/beautifulsoup/

2)Create the whole page structure like the list:
ELEMENT_NAME = {xpath}
with all elements form the our last used page:
http://www.degalukainos.lt/ 
in separate file.

3)Use just the main page

Oleg additional comments:
1)just elements from the body +
2)"Text_element" = "xpath//....."  or "Label_element" = "xpath//..." +
where is the first part of the element should be represent the element as it is and the second part as element var +-
3)All elements should be saved in the one file +
4)for example from the attached picture:"'Kuro kainos degalinÄ—se' - Text" = "//*[@id="filtering"]/div/h1" +-
